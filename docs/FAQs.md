## Troubleshooting

If you are encountering some issues in the API, here is a list of resolutions to some of the problems you may be experiencing.

* Why am I getting a 404?

The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client should not repeat the request without modifications

* Why am I not seeing all my results?

Most API calls accessing a list of resources (e.g., users, issues, etc.). If you are making requests and receiving an incomplete set of results, a response is specified in an unsupported content type.

* Why am I getting a 500?

Server Mistake: Indicates that something went wrong on the server that prevent the server from fulfilling the request.
